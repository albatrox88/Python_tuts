# User Input
# Python allows for user input.
# That means we are able to ask the user for input.

# The method is a bit different in Python 3.6 than Python 2.7.
# Python 3.6 uses the input() method.
# Python 2.7 uses the raw_input() method.

# The following example asks for the username, and when you entered the username, it gets printed on the screen:

# Python 3.6
username = input("Enter username:")
print("Username is: " + username)

# In Python 3.6, the input() function is used to take user input.
# The input() function reads a line from the input and returns it as a string.

# Python 2.7
# username = raw_input("Enter username:")
# print("Username is: " + username)

# In Python 2.7, the raw_input() function is used to take user input.
# The raw_input() function reads a line from the input and returns it as a string.
